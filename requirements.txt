unstructured[local-inference] # Includes paddleocr and other dependencies for local processing
# For paddleocr specifically, you might need to install paddlepaddle separately if it doesn't come with unstructured's extras
# pip install paddlepaddle # or paddlepaddle-gpu
# unstructured.io can be heavy. If you want a lighter setup:
# unstructured
# pdfminer.six # for unstructured
# pytesseract # for unstructured if not using paddle
# And install Tesseract OCR engine separately on your system
